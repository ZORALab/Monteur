<section id="purpose">
	<h2>Main Purpose</h2>
	<p>
		The purpose is to ensure all dependent programs (internal and
		external) are checked to ensure they are available <b>before
		executing</b> the list of <a href="{{< link
		"/internals/commands/" "this" "url-only" />}}">Commands
		Execution Units (CEU)</a>.
		<br/><br/>
		Doing so has a number of benefits:
		<ol>
			<li><p>
				Any recipe users can <b>quickly check through
				the dependencies list without messing with your
				CEU commands list</b>. This is VERY USEFUL for
				organizations who executes tight security
				control (like restricted and vetted supply chain
				of software), working in an offline environment,
				or maintaining your published CI Job recipe.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				The CEU's chain of commands can just <b>focus
				on the execution jobs without worrying
				dependencies checking at all</b>. This keeps
				documenting and maintaining your CI Job recipe
				a lot easier, scalable, straight to the point,
				and simpler algorithm.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Montuer <b>can perform early warning mechanism
				before executing any of the CEU commands</b>.
				This saves expensive CPU and network resources
				when you are operating on mileage environment
				like cloud server or connecting to a limited
				mobile network data.
			</p></li>
		</ol>
		However, please <b>DO NOT CONFUSE this function with your
		product's dependencies (as in your end-product app for your
		customers requiring them to pre-install
		<code>library-XYZ</code>)</b>. Remember: Monteur is a software
		manufacturing tool, not a product distribution one. Therefore,
		you still need to communicate with your customers thoroughly.

<section id="data-structure">
	<h2>Data Structure</h2>
	<p>
		Monteur's dependencies checking function uses a set of fields
		arranged in a single "shopping" array list. The availability
		generally depends on the CI job and is usually optional.
		Currently, most CI Jobs offer such function for pre-checking
		before commands execution.
		<br/><br/>
		The following data structure is the full dependencies checking
		function that you may or may not need them for your recipe
		construction:
