Although there is a codes of conduct in place, we still want to foster a
friendly place for new ideas and developments, to the lowest age of 12. That's
our common goal.

{{< shieldsbadge "Contributor Covenant" "v2.0 Adopted" "#ff69b4" >}}




## Enforcement
Depending on severity of the case, Monteur team recommends these precaution
recommendations to protect all stakeholders.



### Physical and Monetary Abusements
Immediately:

1. Contact local authority such as calling `999` or `911`.
2. Go to the nearest polic station immediately without cleaning up evidence.

{{< note "default" "Remember" >}}
Both ZORALab and Monteur teams can work together with the local authorities
for purging these abusements. Also, **DO NOT WAIT**. The longer you wait, the
essential evidences can be lost over time.

### Think Concequences Before Acting (Including Chit-Chat)
Depending on where you're from and your origin culture, we believe there is one
common algorithm to achieve the goal:
**think about concequences before acting.**

***The easiest way to do it is be one is data-driven habits***. By gathering
measurable data to support your act/idea/thought, it helps you earn the trust
and make informed decision.

Some tips:

1. When you use the word "think", "maybe", "guess" in your expression, work the
   research out and gather data. Otherwise, keep it silent and to yourself.
2. Do not talk about performance without a table of measured data. That's
   considered an offensive act to developers and maintainers.
3. Are there anyway to frame your message so that it leaves positive outcome,
   be it a bad news? Try working it out at your absolute best.

> do the one you have very well."* â€” **William H. McRaven**,
> United States Navy Four-Star Admiral



### Trust is Earned, Not Given
No one likes empty promises and lies. Hence, Monteur team prefers to work
with earning trust instead of given policy. That means it will takes time to
prove your claims.

Some examples:
1. Complete the small tasks instead asking for big one or talking that you can
   handle big one.
   (**Rationale: data-driven and result-oriented**)
2. Do bother starting a new one if you complete what you have now.
   (**Rationale: quality and stay focused**)

> *"If you can't do the little things right, you will never do the big things
> right."*  â€” **William H. McRaven**, United States Navy Four-Star Admiral



### Keep Learning, Not Bloasting
Technologies evolve repidly time after time. Always keep the spirit of learning,
and not showing-off or showing authority. It's about wisdom, experience, and
knowledge in a domain, not you. Blog it if you want.

Some examples:

1. Sometimes, a 6-years old can creates simple algorithm much better than a
   stressed out 30-years old specialized engineer.
2. Ideas are abundance, learn all of them and then decide to choose when it
   comes to application. In other word, stay open for new ideas.
3. A 8-years old boy solved a near-divoce problem for his parent at that time.
   That works out much better than hiring expensive lawyers.
