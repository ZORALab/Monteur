	<h2>Enforcement Concequences</h2>
	<p>
		Long story short, <b>this is a software development community;
		not a forum or social network to brag about or to muster social
		power</b>.
		<br/><br/>
		Our final action is to document all critical wrongdoing in a
		crystal clear, data-driven, legally-compatible, and independent
		format for <b>your local enforcement (e.g. police)
		submission</b>. This is for actions that are clearly against the
		laws.
		<br/><br/>
		Prior to that, if your action is not against the laws but
		harassment or similar, we can submit a report to the service
		provider (e.g. GitHub or GitLab) <b>resulting a temporary or
		permanent bans</b>.
		<br/><br/>
		Of course, to ensure we are fair with our actions, we will
		provide <b>verbal or written warning shall be issued as a
		friendly reminder</b> before escalating to any of the above.

<section id="ethical-pledges">
	<h2>Ethical Pledges</h2>
	<p>
		So what can we do to avoid getting into those nasty
		concequences? It's easy. You just have to:
		<ul>
			<li><p>
				Demonstrate empathy and kindness towards other
				people; AND
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Being respectful of differing opinions,
				viewpoints, and experiences; AND
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Giving and gracefully accepting constructive
				feedback; AND
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Accepting responsibilities and apologizing to
				those affected by the Contributing Partiesâ€™
				mistakes, and learning from the experience; AND
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Focusing on what is best not just for the
				Project communities as individual, but for the
				overall community; AND
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Refrain the use of sexualized languages or
				imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any
				kind; AND
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Refrain from trolling, insulting or derogatory
				comments, and personal or political attack; AND
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Refrain from public or private harassment; AND
			</p></li>
