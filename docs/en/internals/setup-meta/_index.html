<section id="the-problem">
	<h2>The Problem</h2>
	<p>
		It was started with supporting development on various operating
		system and CPU archictures. Due to this, many software and tool
		packages are organized in its own list of distributions, naming
		conventions, and release strategies.
		<br/><br/>
		Among known problems are:
		<ol>
			<li><p>
				<b>There are simply too many platform
				variants and archiving formats</b> offered by
				3rd-party software for great cross-platform
				experiences.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				<b>There are no consistent executable scripts
				(e.g. <code>shell</code> vs
				<code>batch</code>)</b> that allows unilingual
				scripting.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				<b>There are various combinations and
				permutations of methods to make dependencies
				available</b> for a development.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				<b>All the problems above are specific to Setup
				API</b> and not seen in other jobs.
			</p></li>
		</ol>
	</p>
</section>




<section id="the-solution">
	<h2>The Solution</h2>
	<p>
		Since Monteur wants its dependencies management to be managable
		via <b>ONE (1)</b> interface without too many duplications, this
		setup meta processing function is created to solve all the
		problems above.

		To solve the problem above, Monteur uses this <b>Setup Meta
		Processing function to solve those
		<a href="{{< link "/ci-jobs/setup" "this" "url-only" />}}">Setup
		CI Job</a> specific problems above</b> for any amount of the
		supplied variants in a managable manner. The idea is to:
		<ol>
			<li><p>
				Keep the dependency artifact sourcing from
				supplier <b>maintainable using the overwrite
				policy</b>.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				<b>Facilitates various type of built-in sourcing
				methods</b> to meet various sourcing needs.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				<b>Acts as a command intepreter whenever
				possible</b> for ensuring performance
				consistencies across different platforms
				specifically dealing with
				<a href="{{< link "/ci-jobs/setup" "this"
				"url-only" />}}">Setup CI Job</a>.
			</p></li>
		</ol>
		By doing so, we kept the development, maintenance, and using
		<a href="{{< link "/ci-jobs/setup" "this"
		"url-only" />}}">Setup CI Job</a> experiences seamlessly easy
		to perform.
	</p>


	<section id="current-deployment">
		<h3>Current Deployment</h3>
		<p>
			Currently, this function is deployed in the following
			CI Jobs:
			<ol>
				<li><p>
					<a href="{{< link "/ci-jobs/setup/"
						"this" "url-only" />}}">
						Setup</a>
					since Monteur version
					<code>v0.0.1</code>.
				</p></li>
			</ol>
		</p>
	</section>
</section>




<section id="data-structure">
	<h2>Data Structure</h2>
	<p>
		This function is specifically built into the
		<a href="{{< link "/ci-jobs/setup/" "this" "url-only" />}}">
		Setup CI Job</a>. Hence, its data structure is <b>scattered
		across various parts and sections of the CI Job recipe</b>.
		In this specification, all its settings are specified in each
		sub-sections by following the CI Job's recipe's data file
		from top to bottom.
	</p>


	<section id="sourcing-method-type">
		<h3>Sourcing Method Type</h3>
		<p>
			This function offers a number of sourcing method types
			that are offered in its own catalog section offered
			later in this page. Each type has its own explaination
			of its requirements and the how-to in the recipe file.
			The configuration is set via <code>Metadata.Type</code>.
			Here is a code snippet of the recipe file:
{{% highlight bash "linenos=table,hl_lines=,linenostart=1" %}}
[Metadata]
...
Type = 'https-download'

...
{{% /highlight %}}
		</p>

	<section id="recipe-sourcing-section">
		<h3>Recipe Sourcing Section</h3>
		<p>
			This function has a very special method to list all the
			recipe's sourcing data complying to <b>Don't Repeat
			Yourself</b> policy. To do that, the function employs
			<b>the overwriting policy</b> allowing one to first
			write a generic settings and then overwrite the
			needed fields with specific data.
			<br/><br/>
			Depending on the sourcing method type above, some types
			might not need all the fields. Hence, please refer to
			your selected sourcing method type's specification on
			how to construct this section.

			dummy data for specification's referencing purposes:
