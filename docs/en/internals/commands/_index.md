## Data Structure
Monteur's Commands Execution Unit uses a set of variables arranged in an array
of instructions. Each unit has a standardized list of fields shown as follows:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
[[CMD]]
Name = 'Get Publish Branch First Commit for Cleaning'
Condition = [ 'all-all' ]
Type = 'command'
Location = '{{- .WorkingDir -}}'
Source = 'git rev-list --max-parents=0 --abbrev-commit HEAD'
Target = ''
Save = 'FirstCommitID'
SaveRegex = '(\w*)'
SaveStderr = true
ToSTDOUT = '{{- FirstCommitID -}}'
ToSTDERR = 'Completed obtaining first commit ID'
```

The Commands Execution Unit definition is declared by the CI Job. Example, in
Setup, you get `[[Setup]]` instead of `[[CMD]]`. Please refers to the CI Job
documentation.

* `Name`
  1. Compulsory.
  2. Mainly for logging and referencing purposes.
* `Condition`
  1. Compulsory.
  2. the list of supported [Platform ID]({{< link
     "/internals/platform-identification/" "this" "url-only" />}}) where the
     command shall be executed when Monteur is operating on matching platform.
  3. Should `all-all` exists in the array list, it will overwrite all platform
     IDs, both specified and unspecified, as always `true`.
* `Type`
  1. Compulsory.
  2. The Monteur's Commands Execution ID.
* `Location`
  1. Optional.
  2. the directory location for executing the command.
  3. [Variables formatting]({{< link
     "/internals/variables-processing/#variables-formatting" "this"
     "url-only" />}}) is available for this field.
  4. When available, Monteur shall change into that directory before executing
     the command.
* `Source`
  1. Compulsory/Optional depending on Command's `Type`.
  2. usually taken as main input of the command. Please refers to the command's
     specification for its purpose.
  3. [Variables formatting]({{< link
     "/internals/variables-processing/#variables-formatting" "this"
     "url-only" />}}) is available for this field.
* `Target`
  1. Compulsory/Optional depending on Command's `Type`.
  2. usually taken as secondary input of the command or output. Please refers to
     the command's specification for its purpose.
  3. [Variables formatting]({{< link
     "/internals/variables-processing/#variables-formatting" "this"
     "url-only" />}}) is available for this field.
* `Save`
  1. Optional.
  2. The `Key` value for saving the output (e.g. `STDOUT`) of the executed
     commands into the [Variables]({{< link "/internals/variables-processing/"
     "this" "url-only" />}}) list for later use.
* `SaveRegex`
  1. Optional.
  2. A regular expression filter to process the data prior saving.
  3. Use capturing group in your regex using parenthesis `(...)`. Every captured
     groups shall be concatenated from left to right. Example:
     `(\w{1,}):(\s{1}).{1,}\((\d+.\d+%)\)` for `total:    statement  (50.0%)`
     yields `total 50.0%`.
  4. **DO NOT** include the regex slashes (as in `/ YOUR_REGEX /`).
  4. Only works if `Save` is enabled (Not empty) and itself is not empty.
* `SaveStderr`
  1. Optional.
  2. Instruct Monteur to save `STDERR` instead of the default `STDOUT` data.
  3. Only works if `Save` is enabled (not empty) and itself is set to `true`
     (boolean).
* `ToSTDOUT`, `ToSTDERR`
  1. Optional.
  2. Dump written string to `STDERR` and `STDOUT` respectively after the command
     is executed successfully.
  3. [Variables formatting]({{< link
     "/internals/variables-processing/#variables-formatting" "this"
     "url-only" />}}) is available for this field **including its own save
     variable**.
  4. No action will be taken respectively if `ToSTDOUT` and `ToSTDERR` are empty
     string (`""`) after formatting.




## Execution Sequences
This section explains Monteur's steps of executing each of its available
commands. There are 2 main activities:

1. The chain of commands are parsed and validated that its `Type` is supported
   by the runtime Monteur.
2. The executions of the chain of commands.


### Step 0: Validate Monteur's Supporting Commands
During the TOML data file parsing for chain of commands, Monteur will check
through each command's `Type` is within its supporting range. Otherwise, Monteur
shall raise an error without executing any of the commands.

Otherwise, Monteur will begin executing the chain of commands.



### Step 1: Process the Current Command
The Commands Execution Unit will then process `Location`, `Source`, and `Target`
with [Variables formatting]({{< link
"/internals/variables-processing/#variables-formatting" "this" "url-only" />}}).

At this point, should there be any processing errors (e.g. bad formatting
clauses), Monteur shall raise that error and the chain of commands is stopped.



### Step 2: Executing The Command
Once all validation and processing are completed, Monteur will then execute
the command and generate its output data (can be structural depending on command
`Type`).



### Step 3: Process Save
If `Save` is set, the generated output is then saved into the Variables List
based on the command `Type`. Should there be any existing variable with the same
`Key` value (with `Save`), Monteur shall overwrite the existing value with the
command output.



### Step 4: Repeat Step 1 for Next Command
The Step 1 process is then repeated for the next command in line. Otherwise,
the chain of commands is completed.




## Available Commands
Monteur shall continuously add new commands from time to time. These are the
currently available commands sorted by `Type`.
