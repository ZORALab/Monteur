This release primarily interate major feature improvements over the first
prototype to standardize its internal operations and external interactions.
There are non-backward compatible changes so please go through this document
clearly for what has changed.

{{< note warning "Heads Up" >}}
There is a bug where the Setup API failed to create the main MonteurFS
directories (See [Issue 44](https://gitlab.com/zoralab/monteur/-/issues/44)).

Please upgrade to Monteur `v0.0.3` or manually create those main directories
for Monteur to work.
