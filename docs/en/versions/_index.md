## Installation
To install Monteur into your operating system, please find your operating system
guides and execute its instructions:



### Debian / Ubuntu
A dedicated apt repository was setup for Debian-based operating system. While
in `root` permission (as in `sudo` all the instructions here):

```bash {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
# get ZORALab public GPG Keys (skip if you done this before with other products)
curl https://www.zoralab.com/pubkey.gpg \
	| gpg --yes --dearmor --output /usr/share/keyrings/zoralab-keyring.gpg

# write source list file (choose either 'stable', 'unstable', 'experimental')
# Here, 'stable' was chosen.
echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/zoralab-keyring.gpg] https://monteur.zoralab.com/releases/deb stable main' \
	| sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zoralab-monteur.list

# perform apt update
apt update -y

# install monteur
apt install montuer -y

# exit root account (For sudoer, please skip this step)
exit

# test out monteur
monteur help
```

The `apt` repository is always packed with the latest versions. You can check
them out in our
[Releases Section]({{< link "/versions/" "this" "url-only" />}}). Should any
later version is available, it will be rolled-out via the `apt update` and
`apt upgrade`.



### Go
Monteur is completely available for `go get`. Simple issue the following command
against the branch you want it to be installed:

```bash {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
go install gitlab.com/zoralab/monteur/gopkg/app/monteur@main
```

`main` - stable and current branch
`staging` - next stable branch that is under testing.
`next` - bleeding edge branch (unstable due to development).



### Source Codes
Monteur source codes are publicly available at:
https://gitlab.com/zoralab/monteur and are continuously improved from time to
time. We do not package the source codes since Monteur is built entirely using
Go programming language.

Hence it's better to stick to Go standards. You will need
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) software to clone the repository down to your local
system.



### Downloadable Archives Files
Here are some currently available Monteur archived versions for download (either
in `tar.gz` or `zip`) depending on your operating system:
