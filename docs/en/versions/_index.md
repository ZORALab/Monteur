## Installation
To install Monteur into your operating system, please find your operating system
guides and execute its instructions:



### Debian / Ubuntu
A dedicated apt repository was setup for Debian-based operating system. While
in `root` permission (as in `sudo` all the instructions here):

```bash {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
# get ZORALab public GPG Keys (skip if you done this before with other products)
curl https://www.zoralab.com/pubkey.gpg \
	| gpg --yes --dearmor --output /usr/share/keyrings/zoralab-keyring.gpg

# write source list file (choose either 'stable', 'unstable', 'experimental')
# Here, 'stable' was chosen.
echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/zoralab-keyring.gpg] https://monteur.zoralab.com/releases/deb stable main' \
	| sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zoralab-monteur.list

# perform apt update
apt update -y

# install monteur
apt install montuer -y

# exit root account (without 'sudo') and test out monteur
monteur help
```

The `apt` repository is always packed with the latest versions. You can check
them out in our
[Releases Section]({{< link "/versions/" "this" "url-only" />}}). Should any
later version is available, it will be rolled-out via the `apt update` and
`apt upgrade`.
