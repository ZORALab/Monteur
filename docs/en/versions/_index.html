{{% highlight bash "linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1" %}}
# [STEP 1] ZORALab public GPG Keys
# NOTE:
#   1. skip if you done this before for other ZORALAb's products.
#   2. redo this step if apt complains about incompatible key (means we
#      refreshed our keys and you need to get the latest one again).
curl https://www.zoralab.com/pubkey.gpg \
	| gpg --yes --dearmor --output /usr/share/keyrings/zoralab-keyring.gpg

# [STEP 2] Create APT Source List File
# Please replace any tailing upstream to match your needs:
#  1. 'main stable'       - MAIN branch, a stable suite (DEFAULT)
#  2. 'staging unstable'  - STAGING branch, a testing/unstable suite
#  3. 'next experimental' - NEXT branch, a bleeding edge experiemntal suite
echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/zoralab-keyring.gpg] https://monteur.zoralab.com/releases/deb main stable' \
	> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zoralab-monteur.list

# [STEP 3] perform apt update
apt update -y

# [STEP 4] install monteur
apt install montuer -y

# [STEP 5] exit root account (If you use 'sudo', please skip this step)
exit

		business direction incompatible with ZORALab's Monteur busienss
		direction. Hence, we migrated the entire repository into GitHub.
