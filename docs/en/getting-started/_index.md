## 1. Install Monteur
For starters, regardless on whether you're here to create a repository with
Montuer supports OR being instructed to setup Monteur for an existing supported
one, you need to install Monteur from our official download portals here
(new windows/tab shall open):

{{< link "/versions" "this" "" "_blank" "button" >}}
Download Monteur
{{< /link >}}




## 2. I'm Here To...
Depending on what you plan to do, this guide shall points you to the right
steps:



### A-Route) Work on Existing Repository Already with Monteur
That's easy, what you probably need to do is setup the localized repository
with the following command:

```bash {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
monteur setup
```

Once done, depending on your operating system (example here is in
Unix/Linux/MacOS operating system), you can source the localized
filesystem by:

```bash {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
source .monteurFS/config/main
```

and you're good to go!



### B-Route) Initialize My Repository with Monteur
To initialize your repository with Monteur, simply head over to our Monteur's
Init API section and follows the guide there properly:

{{< link "/internals/init-api" "this" "" "" "button" >}}
Monteur Init API
{{< /link >}}




## Epilogue
That's all for getting started with Monteur. If you have any queries, please
proceed to contact us via our
