	<h2>GitLab CI Integration</h2>
	<p>
		Monteur is integrated with GitLab CI via its famous
		<code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> config file. The difference is that
		GitLab CI is used for triggering the necessary Monteur's actions
		to operate your project autonomously. In summary, you should
		treat GitLab CI as a virtual autonomous robot working for you.
		<br/><br/>
		A full Debian-based operating system template is shown as
		follows:

	<p>
		This design allows you to operate Monteur in a way independent
		of operating system and without requiring Monteur to build all
		Docker opreating system's specific images. Since CI is specific
		to your project/app, please use the above only as reference.
		<br/><br/>
		<b>We DO NOT recommend you to run Package and Relase CI Job on
		GitLab CI</b> mainly because of the secret GPG key involvement
		for package integrity checking. Since there is an obligation to
		protect those key files, you can operate those CI Jobs on a
		trusted compute system privately and solely on your side.
	</p>

		<h3>GitLab Runner</h3>
		<p>
			In the past, Monteur team tried to setup Rasberry Pi
			3B as the cross operating system's GitLab Runner and
			faced numerous unknown errors to the point that
			<b>we don't recommend you repeating our mistake. If
			possible, please use compute system closer to your
			development system</b>.
			<br/><br/>
			We tested both Docker and Shell Executors. Both works
			well especially with the latter.
