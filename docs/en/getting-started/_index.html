	<h2>Step 1: Install Monteur</h2>
	<p>
		For starter, regardless on whether you're here to create a
		repository or working on existing one, you need to install
		Monteur first. We have our downloads and installation guides
		here (new window will open): <a
			href="{{< link "/versions" "this" "url-only" />}}"
			target="_blank"
			class="button">
		Download and Install Monteur</a>
	</p>
</section>




<section id="step-2-setup-repository">
	<h2>Step 2: Setup Your Repository</h2>
	<p>
		Now that you have Montuer working in your operating system, the
		next step depends on what do you plan to do next, either A or B:
	</p>


	<section id="work-on-existing-repo">
		<h3>(A) Working on Existing Repo</h3>
		<p>
			That's easy. What you probably need is to perform the
			Setup API in your repository with the following command:
{{% highlight bash "linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1" %}}
monteur setup
{{% /highlight %}}
			Depending on what you're working on, please let Monteur
			setup the repository for operations. Once completed,
			your repository is ready. The next time you want to
			start working on it, simple source the localized
			configuration file. Example, for <code>UNIX</code>/
			<code>Linux</code> operating system:
{{% highlight bash "linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1" %}}
source .monteurFS/config/main
{{% /highlight %}}
			and you're good to go!
		</p>
	</section>


	<section id="initialize-a-new-repo">
		<h3>(B) Initialize A New Repo</h3>
		<p>
			To initialize your repository with Monteur, simply head
			over to our Monteur's Init API section and follows the
			guide there:

			<a href="{{< link "/internals/init-api" "this"
				"url-only" />}}"
				class="button">Montuer Init API</a>
