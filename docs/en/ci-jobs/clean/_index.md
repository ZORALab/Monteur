The objective of the job is simple: **to clean the repository up from
development artifacts in a consistent manner with minimal to no further
instructions**.




## Overall Configurations
To configure the job for execution, you need to supply and modify
`.configs/monteur/clean/config.toml` file. These are the various settings for
customizations.



### `[Variables]`
To configure job-wide variables for all cleaning tasks, you can include or
modify the existing `[Variables]` table. Here is an example:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
[Variables]
BuildOptions = "--minify"
```

This table only accepts [Plain Variables Definition]({{< link
"/internals/variables-processing/#plain-variables-definition" "this"
"url-only" />}}).

The values can be any data types as long as it is sensible for direct
replacement in a variable formatting activities.



### `[FMTVariables]`
To configure job-wide formattable variables for all composing tasks, you can
include or modify the existing `[FMTVariables]` table. Here is an example:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
[FMTVariables]
SourceDir = '{{- .WorkingDir -}}/public'
```

This table accepts [Formattable Variables Definition]({{< link
"/internals/variables-processing/#formattable-variables-definition" "this"
"url-only" />}}) (e.g. `{{- .Version -}}`).

These variables shall be processed after the `[Variables]` table and all the
formatting clauses shall be replaced with the given variables. The processed
`Key-Value` output data shall then be backfilled either create or overwrite back
into `[Variables]` table depending on its `Key-Value` existence.




## Cleaners' Configurations
Monteur accepts one cleaner configuration file per publishing channel (e.g.
one `build-log.toml` for `cleaning build job's log directory`). However, the
internal operations allow many cleaner works to be executed simultenously and
asynchonously (e.g. `build-tmp.toml`, `release-log.toml`, `release-tmp.toml`,
`...`). Each configuration file shares the same file structure.



### Storing Location
All cleaning configuration files **SHALL** be stored inside
`.configs/monteur/clean/jobs/` directory.



### File Nature
The configuration file **MUST** have the file extension. Otherwise, it will be
ignored. Currently the following formats are supported and sorted by priority
sequences:

1. `TOML` (`recipe.toml`) - https://github.com/toml-lang/toml

The filename does not affect any of the parsed configurations so feel free to
name it according to your own pattern.



### Data Structure
Each configuration file follows the following data structure:


#### `[Metadata]`
This table houses all the information about the recipe metadata such as its
name, description, and how to source the program. Here is an example:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
[Metadata]
Name = 'Clean Up Build Log Artifacts'
Description = """
Clean up all artifacts for a job.
"""
```

The `Name` field will be used for various internal configurations so Monteur
recommends **keeping it concise and without any weird symbol (space will be
replaced by short dash)**.

The `Description` is mainly for logging and the config file comprehension
purposes. You can write a short description for it.


#### `[Variables]`
This table houses all [Plain Variables Definition]({{< link
"/internals/variables-processing/#plain-variables-definition" "this"
"url-only" />}}) **specific to this cleaner**. Example:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
[Variables]
Job = 'build'
MonteurPath = '.monteurFS'
```

All the variables are either `create` or `overwrite` to the existing variables
list.


#### `[FMTVariables]`
This table houses all [Formattable Variables Definition]({{< link
"/internals/variables-processing/#formattable-variables-definition" "this"
"url-only" />}}) (e.g. `{{- .Version -}}`) **specific to this cleaner**.
Example:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
[FMTVariables]
Target = '{{- .RootDir -}}/{{- .MonteurPath -}}/log/{{- .Job -}}'
```

All formatted variables are either `create` or `overwrite` to the existing
variables list.


#### `[[Dependencies]]`
The `[Dependencies]` is an array of program data for checking all required
programs only for this cleaner. Therefore, it has extra square braces when
defining its data.

It is compliant to Monteur's internal [Dependencies Checking]({{< link
"/internals/dependencies-checking/" "this" "url-only" />}}) function.

Here is an example for defining a list of dependencies:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
[[Dependencies]]
Name = 'Remove in Linux'
Condition = 'linux-all'
Type = 'command'
Command = 'rm'
```


#### `[[CMD]]`
`[CMD]` is basically an array of instructions for executing the cleaner's
cleaning work. Hence, this is why it has extra square braces.

Its values are complying to Monteur's [Commands Execution Units]({{< link
"/internals/commands/" "this" "url-only" />}}). Here is an example:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
[[CMD]]
Name = "Remove Target Directory"
Type = 'delete-recursive-quiet'
Condition = [ 'all-all' ]
Source = '{{- .Target -}}'

[[CMD]]
Name = "Create Target Directory"
Type = 'create-path'
Condition = [ 'all-all' ]
Source = '{{- .Target -}}'
```




## Known Templates
Now that you understand how Monteur executes `Clean` CI Job, fortunately,
Monteur maintains a number of recipes for you to kick-start your deployment.
Here are some currently maintained templates for different deployments:
