The objective of the job is simple: **to execute all packaging for various
deployments seamlessly and consistently on a single host machine with minimal to
no further instructions**.




## Overall Configurations
To configure the job for execution, you need to supply and modify
`.configs/monteur/package/config.toml` file. These are the various settings for
customizations.



### `[Variables]`
To configure job-wide variables for all packaging tasks, you can include or
modify the existing `[Variables]` table. Here is an example:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
[Variables]
TestArguments = "--verbose"
```

This table only accepts [Plain Variables Definition]({{< link
"/internals/variables-processing/#plain-variables-definition" "this"
"url-only" />}}).

The values can be any data types as long as it is sensible for direct
replacement in a variable formatting activities.



### `[FMTVariables]`
To configure job-wide formattable variables for all packaging tasks, you can
include or modify the existing `[FMTVariables]` table. Here is an example:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
[FMTVariables]
MainDir = '{{- .RootDir -}}/gopkg'
```

This table accepts [Formattable Variables Definition]({{< link
"/internals/variables-processing/#formattable-variables-definition" "this"
"url-only" />}}) (e.g. `{{- .Version -}}`).

These variables shall be processed after the `[Variables]` table and all the
formatting clauses shall be replaced with the given variables. The processed
`Key-Value` output data shall then be backfilled either create or overwrite back
into `[Variables]` table depending on its `Key-Value` existence.




## Packages' Configurations
Monteur accepts one packaging recipes file per packaging variant (e.g. one
`deb.toml` for `linux-amd64`, `linux-arm64`, `linux-riscv`, and etc).
However, the internal operations allow many packaging recipes file to run
simultenously and asynchonously (e.g. `deb.toml`, `appimage.toml`, `targz.toml`,
...). Each configuration file shares the same file structure.



### Storing Location
All packaging recipe configuration files **SHALL** be stored inside
`.configs/monteur/package/jobs` directory.




### File Nature
The configuration file **MUST** have the file extension. Otherwise, it will be
ignored. Currently the following formats are supported and sorted by priority
sequences:

1. `TOML` (`recipe.toml`) - https://github.com/toml-lang/toml

The filename does not affect any of the parsed configurations so feel free to
name it according to your own pattern. Monteur recommends **using packaging
recipe name** to keep sorting work sane. Example: `deb.toml` for all
`.deb` packages.



### Data Structure
Each configuration file follows the following data structure:


#### `[Metadata]`
This table houses all the information about the packaging recipe metadata such
as its name, description, and its supported types. Here is an example:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
Name = 'DEB'
Description = """
Package monteur into .deb package file using manual commands.
"""
Type = 'deb-manual'
```

The `Name` field will be used for various internal configurations for Monteur's
packaging recipe identifications and logging purposes.

The `Description` is mainly for logging and the config file comprehension
purposes. You can write a short description for it.

The `Type` is the type of supported packaging modes for Monteur to execute
the recipes. The currently supported modes are:

* `deb-manual` - compile to `.deb` package but using manual commands instead.
  Useful for external compilers like `debuild`, `sbuild`, or `fpm`.
* `manual` - compile package completely manually using commands. It is for those
  who wants complete manual controls.


#### `[Variables]`
This table houses all [Plain Variables Definition]({{< link
"/internals/variables-processing/#plain-variables-definition" "this"
"url-only" />}}) **specific to this packaging recipes**. It shall appears onto
all listed packages. Example:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
[Variables]
GPGID = 'hello@zoralab.com'
GPGExistence = ''  # to be filled later for verifications
ChangelogFrom = 'origin/staging'
ChangelogTo = 'origin/main'
```

All the variables are either `create` or `overwrite` to the existing variables
list.


#### `[FMTVariables]`
This table houses all [Formattable Variables Definition]({{< link
"/internals/variables-processing/#formattable-variables-definition" "this"
"url-only" />}}) (e.g. `{{- .Version -}}`) **specific to this packaging
recipe**. It shall appears onto all listed packages. Example:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
[FMTVariables]
Lintian = '{{- .DataDir -}}/debian/lintian'
Profile = '{{- .DataDir -}}/debian/profiles'
```

All formatted variables are either `create` or `overwrite` to the existing
variables list.


#### `[[Dependencies]]`
The `[Dependencies]` is an array of programs due for existence checking
specifically **meant for the entire packaging recipe**. Therefore, it has extra
square braces when defining its data.

It is compliant to Monteur's internal [Dependencies Checking]({{< link
"/internals/dependencies-checking/" "this" "url-only" />}}) function.

Here is an example for defining a list of dependencies:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
[[Dependencies]]
Name = 'DEB Builder'
Condition = 'all-all'
Type = 'command'
Command = 'debuild'

[[Dependencies]]
Name = 'GPG Tool'
Condition = 'all-all'
Type = 'command'
Command = 'gpg'

[[Dependencies]]
Name = 'Git for Changelog Generation'
Condition = 'all-all'
Type = 'command'
Command = 'git'
```


#### `[Packages.XXX]`
`[Package]` are the list of packages to be packaged by the `[CMD]` table. All
these packages shall be iterated with the `[CMD]` table with the given variables
above, including a now processed list of `ChangelogEntries` value (now a
`[]string`).

Depending on `Metadata.Type`, Monteur will execute a preparation executions
before executing the `[CMD]` for a package. This reduces the need to build large
`[CMD]` commands list and promotes consistency.

For `Metadata.Type` set to `manual`, to ensure you have complete control, this
recipe type shall not execute the preparation sequences and all the packages are
directly and completely controlled by `[CMD]`.

The required fields are shown as follows:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=["1-13"],linenostart=1}
[Packages.001]
OS = [ 'linux' ]
Arch = [ 'amd64' ]
Name = '{{- .PkgName -}}-{{- .PkgVersion -}}-{{- .PkgOS -}}-{{- .PkgArch -}}'
Changelog = '{{- .DataDir -}}/changelog-{{- .PkgArch -}}'
Distribution = [
        'stable',
]
BuildSource = false

[Packages.001.Files]
'{{- .PackageDir -}}/monteur' = '{{- .BuildDir -}}/{{- .PkgOS -}}-{{- .PkgArch -}}'
'{{- .PackageDir -}}/License.pdf' = '{{- .LicensePath -}}'


[Packages.002]
OS = [ 'linux' ]
Arch = [ 'arm64' ]
Name = '{{- .App.ID -}}-{{- .App.Version -}}-{{- .PkgOS -}}-{{- .PkgArch -}}'
Changelog = '{{- .DataDir -}}/changelog-{{- .PkgArch -}}'
Distribution = [
        'stable',
]
BuildSource = false

[Packages.002.Files]
'{{- .PackageDir -}}/monteur' = '{{- .BuildDir -}}/{{- .PkgOS -}}-{{- .PkgArch -}}'
'{{- .PackageDir -}}/License.pdf' = '{{- .LicensePath -}}'
```

The fields' specifications are documented in the [Package Meta]({{< link
"/internals/package/meta/" "this" "url-only" />}}) section. For package API,
you need the following fields (**COMPULSORY**):

* `[Package.XXX]` - the package tag for organization purposes.
* `OS` - supported operating system. **Minimum 1**.
* `Arch` - supported CPU architecture. **Minimum 1**.
* `Name` - the package name.
* `Changelog` - the persistent changelog filepath for certain packager.
* `Distribution` - supported distributions of the operating system.
   **Minimum 1**.
* `BuildSource` - decision to build source-code package or otherwise.
* `[Package.XXX.Files]` - the list of files for packaging.


#### `[[CMD]]`
`[CMD]` is basically the array of packaging commands or instructions for
executing the packaging algorithms across each listed packages. Hence, this is
why it has extra square braces.

Its values are complying to Monteur's [Commands Execution Units]({{< link
"/internals/commands/" "this" "url-only" />}}). Here is an example:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
[CMD]]
Name = "Get GPG Secret Key for Verifications"
Type = 'command'
Condition = [ 'all-all' ]
Source = 'gpg --list-secret-keys "{{- .GPGID }}"'
Save = 'GPGExistence'

[[CMD]]
Name = "Verify GPG Secret Key Must Exists For Signing"
Type = 'is-not-empty'
Condition = [ 'all-all' ]
Source = '{{- .GPGExistence -}}'

[[CMD]]
Name = "Compile Deb Package"
Type = 'command'
Condition = [ 'all-all' ]
Location = '{{- .PackageDir -}}'
Source = 'debuild -b -k{{- .GPGID }} -a{{- index .PkgArch 0 }}'

...
```




## Known Templates
