#### Installation Instructions
1. You should download and place the recipe into your
   `<config>/package/jobs/` directory with the name `targz.toml`.
2. Once done, edit the configuration file for:
   1. `Packages.XXX` - your `.tar.gz` packages list. Duplicate if there are more
      build variants to be packaged into `.tar.gz` pack.
   2. `Packages.XXX.OS` - list of supported operating system for this package.
   3. `Packages.XXX.Arch` - list of supported CPU architecture for this package.
   4. `Packages.XXX.Name` - filename without extension for this package.
   5. `Packages.XXX.Distribution` - list of supported distributions.
   11. `Packages.XXX.BuildSource` - instruct Monteur to package a source code
       pack or a binary pack (not both). If both are needed, duplicate
       the recipe since they are essentially 2 different packages.
   12. `[Packages.XXX.Files]` - the list of files to be assembled by Monteur
       for packaging.
