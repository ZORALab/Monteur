The objective of distributing the recipe is simple: **to make building `.deb`
packages painlessly in a consistent manner with minimal to no further
instructions**.

Debuild instructions are available at:
https://wiki.debian.org/BuildingTutorial

All recipes are arranged based on its own
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and is not directly related to
Monteur's actual release version. Hence, feel free to explore each versions
to suit your CI needs.




## Recipe Versions
Here are the available Package API recipe for `debuild` integrations. Please
read through your selected version's details on what has changed, what is
required, and how to customize and used them.

The arrangement are the latest at the top or first.



### Version 2.0.0
Version 2.0.0 `debuild` Package API is available for download here:
{{< link "/ci-jobs/package/debuild/debuild-v2p0p0.toml" "this" "" "" "button"
	"" "download" >}}
debuild-v2p0p0.toml
{{< /link >}}

| Min Requirements     | Values                           |
|:---------------------|---------------------------------:|
| Monteur Version      | `v0.0.2`                         |
| Supported Platforms  | follows `debuild`'s availability |


#### Installation Instructions
1. You should download and place the recipe into your
   `<config>/package/jobs/` directory with the name `debuild.toml`.
2. Once done, edit the configuration file for:
   1. `Variables.GPGID` - your GPG release singing key where private key is
      available.
   2. `Packages.XXX` - your .deb packages list item. Duplicate if there are more
      build variants.
   3. `Packages.XXX.OS` - list of supported operating system for this `.deb`
      package.
   4. `Packages.XXX.Arch` - list of supported CPU architecture for this `.deb`
      package.
   5. `Packages.XXX.Changelog` - the filepath for sourcing changelog data.
   6. `Packages.XXX.Distribution` - an array of supported distributions.
   7. `Packages.XXX.BuildSource` - instruct Monteur to package a source code
       pack or a binary pack (not both). If both are needed, duplicate
       the recipe since they are essentially 2 different packages.
   8. `[Packages.XXX.Files]` - the list of files to be assembled by Monteur
       for packaging.

For detailed information about each fields, visit:
[Package Specification Data Structure]({{< link
"/ci-jobs/package/#data-structure" "this" "url-only" />}}) for more info.


#### Changes
1. **Non-Backward Compatible** - Removed `[Changelog]` as Monteur `v0.0.2` now
   ports it to [DEB Changelog Prepare API]({{< link
   "/ci-jobs/prepare/changelog-deb/" "this" "url-only" />}}).
2. *Backward Compatible* - Applied FMTVariables to many Packages fields instead
   of hardcoding to specific ones.
