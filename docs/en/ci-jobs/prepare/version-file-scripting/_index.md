The objective of distributing the recipe is simple: **to script version file
so that they are aligned to Monteur's app metadata's Version field, allowing
user to only update Version via Monteur's app metadata painlessly, in a
consistent manner with minimal to no further instructions**.

All recipes are arranged based on its own
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and is not directly related to
Monteur's actual release version. Hence, feel free to explore each versions
to suit your CI needs.
