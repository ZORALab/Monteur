The objective of distributing the recipe is simple: **to script version into Go
source code so that they are aligned with Monteur's app metadata's Version
field, allowing user to only update Version via Monteur's app metadata
painlessly, in a consistent manner with minimal to no further instructions**.

All recipes are arranged based on its own
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and is not directly related to
Monteur's actual release version. Hence, feel free to explore each versions
to suit your CI needs.
