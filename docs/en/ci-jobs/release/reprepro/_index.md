The objective of distributing the recipe is simple: **to make upstreaming `.deb`
packages in a consistent manner with minimal to no further instructions**.

Reprepro instructions are available at:
https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/SetupWithReprepro

All recipes are arranged based on its own
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and is not directly related to
Monteur's actual release version. Hence, feel free to explore each versions
to suit your CI needs.




## One-time Setup
Reprepro requires a 1-time setup to meet its requirements. All you need to do is
creating the `conf/distributions` file in your `.DataDir` (data directory) meant
for reprepro. The content of the file are something as such:

```yaml {linenos=table,hl_lines=["1-8"],linenostart=1}
Origin: monteur.zoralab.com/releases/deb
Label: ZORALab's Monteur Deb Package (Main Branch)
Codename: main
Suite: stable
Architectures: amd64
Components: stable
Description: software manufacturing automation tool in one single app.
SignWith: hello@zoralab.com

Origin: monteur.zoralab.com/releases/deb
Label: ZORALab's Monteur Deb Package (Staging)
Codename: staging
Suite: unstable
Architectures: amd64
Components: unstable
Description: software manufacturing automation tool in one single app.
SignWith: hello@zoralab.com

Origin: monteur.zoralab.com/releases/deb
Label: ZORALab's Monteur Deb Package (Next)
Codename: next
Suite: experimental
Architectures: amd64
Components: experimental
Description: software manufacturing automation tool in one single app.
SignWith: hello@zoralab.com
```

* `Origin` - the URI of the source.list. This is where users add the download
  location into `/etc/apt/source.list.d/` directory.
* `Label` - name of the package series.
* `Codename` - controlled field. Denotes it to your branch name.
* `Suite` - stick to either `stable`, `unstable`, or `experimental`. Otherwise,
   if you release it to official OS, stick to their official release codenames.
* `Architectures` - supported architectures separated by space (` `). (E.x:
  `amd64 arm64 i386`). You may update this field over-time as you scale.
* `Components` - Distribution components. When in doubt, keep it to the same
  as `Suite`.
* `Description` - the abstract of the package. Keep it short and max 80
  characters.
* `SignWith` - your GPG signing key ID.

This will make user add your `sources.list` as:

```
deb https://{{- .Origin }} {{ .Codename }} {{ .Components }}

# example above:
deb https://monteur.zoralab.com/releases/deb main stable
```

And apt search will provide a pattern as:

```
{{ .AppName }}/{{- .Suite }} {{ .PkgVersion }} {{ .PkgArch }}
  {{ .Description }}

# Example
monteur/stable 0.0.1 amd64
  software manufacturing automation tool in one single app.
```

      visibility to the `conf/distributions` file setup earlier.
   3. `Releases.Target` - your reprepro output directory.
