	<h2>The Problems</h2>
	<p>
		Dated to year 2020, there is a realization within
		<a href="https://www.zoralab.com">ZORALab</a> team that their
		projects and products had overly relying on 3rd-party vendor
		locked-in continuous integration services like
		<a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/">GitLab CI</a>,
		<a href="https://circleci.com/">Circle CI</a>,
		and <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>. The team
		also technically reviewed
		<a href="https://www.jenkins.io/">Jenkins CI</a> but found that
		it was gigantic and quite heavy as an independent platform
		service.
		<br/><br/>
		Among the key vulnerabilities discovered were:
		<ol>
			<li><p>
				<b>The project becomes very vulnerable to these
				locked-in vendors</b>. Should any of these
				vendors perform business-wide direction changes
				(<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/01/27/gitlab_removes_starter_tier/">GitLab CI Case Exhibits I</a>,
				<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/gitlab-reshuffles-its-paid-subscription-plans/">GitLab CI Case Exhibits II</a>,
				<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/uah6n5/gitlab_kicking_off_all_free_accounts_with_more/">GitLab CI Case Exhibits III</a>,
				<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/11/02/travis_ci_pricng/">Travis CI Case Exhibits I</a>,
				<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/travis-cis-new-pricing-plan-threw-wrench-my-open-source-works">Travis CI Case Exhibits II</a>,
				and
				<a href="https://devclass.com/2020/11/25/travis-ci-open-source-engagement/">Travis CI Case Exhibits III</a>),
				to change such a critical CI service tool
				while still continuously developing the project
				can be very cumbersome and can take months to
				change.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				<b>Inflexible, vendor-specific, and
				custom-brewed instructions scripts</b>. The
				critical CI can <b>ONLY and ONLINE ONLY</b> be
				running on these third-party platforms of your
				choice. There is NO WAY to run CI locally in an
				offline, decentralized, and independent manner.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				<b>Global geo-political instability that can
				instantly kill one or more project entirely
				anytime</b>. Should the geo-political
				implication is unfavorable to the project (<a
href="https://github.com/1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us">GitHub Exihibit I</a>,
				<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-suspends-accounts-of-russian-devs-at-sanctioned-companies/">GitHub Exihibit II</a>,
				<a
href="https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000041719488/en">GitHub Exihibit III</a>,
				<a
href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24886102">GitLab Exihibit I</a>,
				<a
href="https://dev.to/banji220/gitlab-has-blocked-iran-1hn5">GitLab Exihibit II</a>,
				and
				<a
href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/353869">GitLab Exihibit III</a>),
				there is little efforts these service providers
				can do but to comply with their country of
				origin's export restrictions.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				<b>Project-specific, non-reusable CI
				investment</b> across different projects. This
				means it is very hard to roll out updates for
				the CI script across multiple projects there are
				using the same CI job.
			</p></li>
		</ol>
		Hence, the <a href="https://www.zoralab.com">ZORALab</a> team
		know they have to do something about it to remove these
		vulnerabilities as soon possible before something bad happen
		(where it did on May 1st, 2022, even to this Monteur project
		itself).

<section id="the-solution">
	<h2>The Solution</h2>
	<p>
		The <a href="https://www.zoralab.com">ZORALab</a> team
		immediately put this Monteur project at work. <b>Monteur CI Jobs
		specifically facilitates anyone or everyone a consistent
		implementations of CI at decentralized, offline-capable, down
		to work laptop level</b>. This should solve the geo-politics
		instability vulnerability.
		<br/><br/>
		To make sure Monteur's customers do not suffer the never ending
		SHELL+BATCH scripting choice, <b>Monteur itself is works as
		an intepreter executing its CI commands based on a standardized
		<a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">TOML data
		format</a></b>. This should solve the portability matter related
		to the CI script.
		<br/><br/>
		The CI Job TOML data file is <b>continuously designed and tested
		across time to formulate a generic job for interacting various
		3rd-party software in the project and existing 3rd-party CI
		services</b>. Due to the generic nature of the CI Job, the
		distribution and update rolling to any of the existing CI Job
		script can be easily rolled out across various project, thus
		solving the non-reusable investment vulnerability.
		<br/><br/>
		To keep communications simple, Monteur keeps the CI stages based
		on brewing a cup of artistic coffee. That way, it's easier to
		communicate between technical folks and non-technical folks.

	<section id="open-source-distribution">
		<h3>Open Source Licensed Distribution</h3>
		<p>
			Given the fact that there weren't any open-source CI
			tool like Monteur in the market and those
			vulnerabilities stated are too vital for other projects,
			<b>we decided to license the entire Monteur software as
			<a href="{{< link "/licenses/" "this" "url-only" />}}">
				Apache 2.0</a>
			to help others open-source developers and small
			companies that could not afford the 3rd-party CI service
			providers</b>.
			<br/><br/>
			In case you're worrying that somewhere in the future
			where
			<a href="https://www.zoralab.com">ZORALab</a> may
			disappear as well, please feel free to <a href="{{< link
			"/versions/" "this" "url-only" />}}">keep a copy of the
			source codes</a>.

	<h2>Available CI Jobs</h2>
	<p>
		To date, Monteur had developed the following CI Jobs for
		specific needs. Please remember that each CI Jobs has its own
		currently maintained job recipes for known platforms and
		interacting 3rd-party software. Here are the available CI Jobs:
