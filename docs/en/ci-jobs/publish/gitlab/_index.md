The objective of distributing the recipe is simple: **to make publishing to
GitLab Pages carried out in a consistent manner with minimal to no further
instructions**.

GitLab Pages is available at: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/

All recipes are arranged based on its own
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and is not directly related to
Monteur's actual release version. Hence, feel free to explore each versions
to suit your CI needs.




## One-time Setup
Due to the recipe nature of using `gh-pages` branch for publications, you need
to setup that branch with a 1-time setup before use. Otherwise, the recipe shall
fail spectacularly.

To begin, simply execute the following git commands to create an empty
`gh-pages` branch:

{{< note warning "Be Careful" >}}
Make sure you perform the following with a git repository on a clean status
branch (no staging). Otherwise, you will lose files as one of the command
actually deletes everything.
{{< /note >}}

```bash {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
$ git checkout --orphan gh-pages
$ git reset --hard
$ git clean -fd
$ git commit --allow-empty -m "Init"
$ git push origin gh-pages:gh-pages
$ git checkout <back to your work branch>
```
