	<h2>One Time Setup</h2>
	<p>
		To ensure maximum compatibility with the recipe, you might need
		to setup your build system with some of the <code>Go</code>
		specific one-time setup into your build system.
	</p>


	<section id="cross-build">
		<h3>Cross Build</h3>
		<p>
			There is a very high chance that you will perform
			cross-build in your current build system. Unfortunately,
			<code>Go</code> has yet to completely support its
			internal linking feature for all its offering CPU
			architectures
			(See <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/50405">
			Issue 50405</a>).
			<br/><br/>
			Hence, you need to at least make sure the correct
			<code>crossbuild-essentials</code> tools are readily
			available in your operating system. Here are some
			examples for installing cross-building essential tools
			for <code>armhf</code> and <code>aarch64</code>:
{{% highlight bash "linenos=table,hl_lines=,linenostart=1" %}}
apt install crossbuild-essential-armhf
apt install crossbuild-essential-aarch64
{{% /highlight %}}
