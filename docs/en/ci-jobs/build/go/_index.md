#### Installation Instructions
1. You should download and place the recipe into your
   `<config>/app/variants/` directory with the name pattern `OS-ARCH.toml` like
   `linux-amd64.toml`.
2. Once done, edit the configuration file for:
   1. `Metadata.Name` - rename the name accordingly. Recommended `<OS>-<ARCH>`
      like `linux-amd64`.
   2. `Metadata.Description` - update accordingly by replacing the `<APP>`,
      `<OS>`, `<CPU>` to the appropriate values.
   3. `Variables.PlatformOS` - update the value accordingly to the target OS
      (e.g. `linux`).
   4. `Variables.PlatformCPU` - update the value accordingly to the target CPU
      architecture (e.g. `amd64`).
   5. `Variables.PlatformExt` - update the file extension if needed (e.g.
      `.exe`). Otherwise, leave it blank.
   6. `Variables.BuildFlags` - your build arguments matching the current
       variant. Please remove any non-applicable argument when needed (e.g.
       `-buildmode=pie` for `windows`).
   7. `FMTVariables.SrcPath` - filepath to your `main.go`.

[Build Specification Data Structure]({{< link
"/ci-jobs/build/#data-structure" "this" "url-only" />}}) for more info.


#### Changes
1. *Backward Compatible* - Created the base TOML configuration recipe.
2. *Backward Compatible* - Integrated with GitLab CI.
3. *Backward Compatible* - Uses `go` with `-buildmode=pie -ldflags "-s -w"` as
   default arguments.
