The objective of the job is simple: **to execute all the test suites easily
and seamlessly whenever requested in a consistent manner with minimal to no
further instructions**.




## Overall Configurations
To configure the job for execution, you need to supply and modify
`.configs/monteur/build/config.toml` file. These are the various settings for
customizations.



### `[Variables]`
To configure job-wide variables for all publishing tasks, you can include or
modify the existing `[Variables]` table. Here is an example:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
[Variables]
TestArguments = "--verbose"
```

This table only accepts [Plain Variables Definition]({{< link
"/internals/variables-processing/#plain-variables-definition" "this"
"url-only" />}}).

The values can be any data types as long as it is sensible for direct
replacement in a variable formatting activities.



### `[FMTVariables]`
To configure job-wide formattable variables for all composing tasks, you can
include or modify the existing `[FMTVariables]` table. Here is an example:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
[FMTVariables]
MainDir = '{{- .RootDir -}}/gopkg'
```

This table accepts [Formattable Variables Definition]({{< link
"/internals/variables-processing/#formattable-variables-definition" "this"
"url-only" />}}) (e.g. `{{- .Version -}}`).

These variables shall be processed after the `[Variables]` table and all the
formatting clauses shall be replaced with the given variables. The processed
`Key-Value` output data shall then be backfilled either create or overwrite back
into `[Variables]` table depending on its `Key-Value` existence.




## Builds' Configurations
Monteur accepts one build configuration file per build variant (e.g. one
`linux-amd64.toml` for `app on Linux Operating System with x86_64 CPU`).
However, the internal operations allow many programs to build simultenously
and asynchonously (e.g. `darwin-amd64.toml`, `linux-arm64.toml`,
`linux-arm.toml`, ...). Each tester configuration file shares the same file
structure.



### Storing Location
All test configuration files **SHALL** be stored inside
`.configs/monteur/app/variants/` directory.

These config files are **also used across various build related CI Jobs** like
[Package API]({{< link "/ci-jobs/package/" "this" "url-only" />}}) and
[Release API]({{< link "/ci-jobs/release/" "this" "url-only" />}}).



### File Nature
The configuration file **MUST** have the file extension. Otherwise, it will be
ignored. Currently the following formats are supported and sorted by priority
sequences:

1. `TOML` (`program.toml`) - https://github.com/toml-lang/toml

The filename does not affect any of the parsed configurations so feel free to
name it according to your own pattern. Monteur recommends
**using [Platform ID]({{< link "/internals/platform-identification/" "this"
"url-only" />}})** to keep sorting work sane. Example: `linux-amd64.toml` for
`Linux Operating System` with `AMD64` CPU Architecture.



### Data Structure
Each configuration file follows the following data structure:


#### `[Metadata]`
This table houses all the information about the program metadata such as its
name, description, and how to source the program. Here is an example:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
[Metadata]
Name = 'Gitlab Pages'
Description = """
Publishing using Hugo static site generator directly onto GitLab Pages.
"""
```

The `Name` field will be used for various internal configurations so Monteur
recommends **using [Platform ID]({{< link "/internals/platform-identification/"
"this" "url-only" />}})**.

The `Description` is mainly for logging and the config file comprehension
purposes. You can write a short description for it.

These variables are used across various build related CI Jobs like
[Package API]({{< link "/ci-jobs/package/" "this" "url-only" />}}) and
[Release API]({{< link "/ci-jobs/release/" "this" "url-only" />}}).


#### `[Variables]`
This table houses all [Plain Variables Definition]({{< link
"/internals/variables-processing/#plain-variables-definition" "this"
"url-only" />}}) **specific to this variant build**. Example:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
[Variables]
MainLang = 'en'
```

All the variables are either `create` or `overwrite` to the existing variables
list.

These variables are used across various build related CI Jobs like
[Package API]({{< link "/ci-jobs/package/" "this" "url-only" />}}) and
[Release API]({{< link "/ci-jobs/release/" "this" "url-only" />}}).


#### `[FMTVariables]`
This table houses all [Formattable Variables Definition]({{< link
"/internals/variables-processing/#formattable-variables-definition" "this"
"url-only" />}}) (e.g. `{{- .Version -}}`) **specific to this variant build**.
Example:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
[FMTVariables]
DataDir = '{{- .RootDir -}}/data'
```

All formatted variables are either `create` or `overwrite` to the existing
variables list.

These variables are used across various build related CI Jobs like
[Package API]({{< link "/ci-jobs/package/" "this" "url-only" />}}) and
[Release API]({{< link "/ci-jobs/release/" "this" "url-only" />}}).


#### `[[BuildDeps]]`
The `[BuildDeps]` is an array of program data for checking all required
programs only for this `Build` task. Therefore, it has extra square braces
when defining its data.

**DO NOT CONFUSE `[BuildDeps]` with your product's dependencies**. This
design was meant for any external programs that has additional setup
configurations (e.g. building from source codes requires a bunch of libraries
and make programs available as commands and etc). Hence, it's entirely optional
to have this table.

Here is an example for defining a list of dependencies:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
[[BuildDeps]]
Name = 'Go'
Condition = 'all-all'
Type = 'command'
Command = 'go'
```

For each dependency, the `Name` is mainly for logging and referencing purposes.
The `Command` however, is the program's command name or library name depending
on `Type`. On UNIX system, shell's `alias`es are not supported and will never be
visible to Monteur.

Example: for `Git Version Control Software`, the `Name` can be anything but the
`Command` **SHALL ALWAYS** be the executable name: `git`.

`Condition` is the Montuer's `OS-ARCH` platform identification ID. See
[Platform Identification]({{< link "/internals/platform-identification" "this"
"url-only" />}}) for more info about its value.

Currently, Monteur supports the following `Type` values:

* `command` - identify by terminal command (e.g. `hugo`, `git`, ...)


#### `[[BuildCMD]]`
`[BuildCMD]` is basically an array of instructions for building the software of
a specific variant. Hence, this is why it has extra square braces.

Its values are complying to Monteur's [Commands Execution Units]({{< link
"/internals/commands/" "this" "url-only" />}}). Here is an example:

```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=1}
[[BuildCMD]]
Name = "Execute Go Build"
Type = 'command'
Condition = 'all-all'
Location = '{{- .RootDir -}}/gopkg'
Source = 'go build -ldflags "-s -w" -o "{{- .BuildPath -}}" "{{- .AppPath -}}"'

...
```




## Known Templates

Monteur maintains a number of recipes for you to kick-start your deployment.
Here are some currently maintained templates for different deployments:
