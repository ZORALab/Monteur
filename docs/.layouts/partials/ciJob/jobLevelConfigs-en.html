<p>
	Montuer does facilitate a job-wide configurations file for configuring
	{{ .JobTitle }} CI Job over all settings and supplying job-wide variables.
	<br/><br/>
	The configurations, by default, are stored in the data file located in:
{{ .Filepath }}
	<br/>
	The file <b>MUST be strictly named <code>config</code> alongside with
	the following supported data format's file extension</b>. Currently,
	Monteur offers the following supported formats, arranged in priority by
	sequences:
	<ul>
		<li><p>
			<code>.toml (TOML)</code> -
			<a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">
				https://github.com/toml-lang/toml</a>
		</p></li>
	</ul>
		The file structure of the recipe configuration file is detailed
		from top to bottom in the following sub-sections, in sequences.
